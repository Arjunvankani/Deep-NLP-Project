# Research Paper Simplification Pipeline Design

This system is designed to simplify complex academic Research Paper into more readable forms without losing the original meaning. It targets vocabulary and sentence structure to enhance comprehension.

## 1. Pre-processing Module

The pre-processing module prepares the input text for simplification through several steps:

- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.) using OCR if necessary.
- **Tokenization**: Break down the text into individual words and punctuation marks.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Label each token with its corresponding part of speech.
- **Syntactic Parsing**: Analyze sentences to determine their syntactic structure.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and tag named entities to avoid simplifying proper nouns that could lose meaning.
- **Phrase Extraction**: Identify complex phrases that may need simplification.
- **Normalization**: Standardize text by converting it to lowercase, expanding contractions, and correcting spelling errors.

## 2. Definition of Simplification (Feature-wise)

Simplification is defined by two main features:

- **Vocabulary Simplification**: Identify complex words and replace them with simpler synonyms based on context, maintaining a balance between simplicity and semantic fidelity.
- **Sentence Structure Simplification**: Decompose complex sentences into simpler ones by splitting or rephrasing while maintaining coherence and cohesion.

## 3. Scope of Simplification

The system aims to simplify:

- **Academic Texts**: Focus on research papers, technical reports, and educational materials.
- **Complex Sentences**: Target sentences with multiple clauses, passive voice, and advanced vocabulary.
- **Domain-Specific Jargon**: Simplify terminology specific to domains like law, medicine, and science.

## 4. Problem Formulation

- **Input**: A complex sentence or paragraph from an academic text.
- **Output**: A simplified version of the input text that is easier to read and understand.
- **Loss Function**: A composite loss function that includes:
  - **BLEU Score**: To measure the fluency of the generated text against reference simplifications.
  - **SARI Score**: To evaluate the quality of the simplification by comparing the system output with both the original and reference texts.
  - **Semantic Similarity**: To ensure the meaning is preserved, possibly using embeddings from models like BERT.

## 5. Methodology at a Broad Level

- **Model Type**: A transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model, such as T5 or a fine-tuned version of GPT-3, known for generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.
- **Training Methodology**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Train the model on a dataset of complex-simple sentence pairs.
  - **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models on large corpora and fine-tune on domain-specific datasets.
  - **Curriculum Learning**: Start training with simpler tasks and gradually increase complexity to improve learning efficiency.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Use techniques like back-translation and paraphrasing to enrich the training dataset and improve the model's robustness.
